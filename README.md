Task 2: Data Cleaning and EDA on Titanic Dataset (Prodigy InfoTech Internship)

# Titanic Dataset – Data Cleaning and EDA

This project is part of the **Prodigy InfoTech Data Analyst Internship**.

## ✅ Objective:
Perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset to explore relationships between variables and identify meaningful patterns and trends.

---

## 📁 Dataset
- [Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)
- File used: `train.csv`

---

## 🧹 Data Cleaning Steps:
- Filled missing `Age` values using median
- Filled missing `Embarked` values using mode
- Dropped `Cabin` column (too many nulls)
- Removed irrelevant columns: `Name`, `Ticket`, `PassengerId`

---

## 📊 EDA Visualizations:
- Survival count plot
- Gender distribution
- Age distribution
- Survival by gender
- Survival by class
- Age vs survival (boxplot)
- Survival by embarkation port
- Correlation heatmap (numerical features only)

---

## 🧠 Key Insights:
- Females had a higher survival rate
- 1st class passengers survived more
- Most passengers were aged 20–40
- Passengers who paid higher fares had better survival

---

## 💻 Tools Used:
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook
